		Known Bugs and Limitations

Bugs:
   accept behaves strangely when number of characters typed exceeds
expected number of characters.

   key must be called before anything has been typed; if not, the data
will be echoed, ^C will kill, etc.  This is problematic for programs
that try to respond to cursor keys, etc. using key.

   The system is case sensitive and all Forth words are lower case.
   However, input number conversion is case insensitive (0a = 0A).

   abort (and abort") actually say "ok" when they are done.

   : foo [ :noname ; ( foo is now findable)

   chdir gives no indication of failure.

   if abort occurs while loading a command line file (which can happen
if an unknown file is 'fload'ed) you will land in the interactive
interpreter.

Limitations:
   move only copies a byte at a time; it could be faster.

   test for eof in read-line isn't very portable and doesn't work if
tty is in raw mode. (How could you ever detect EOF in raw mode?)

   By default, ( comments do not span lines in files.  Load ansparen.fr
to get the standard (.

   Word names are five characters and a hash code instead of the required
31 characters.  This is a characteristic inherited from progenitors that
were memory conscious.  It rarely causes problems and I don't feel like
changing it.
