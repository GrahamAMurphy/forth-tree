Modified cmach/macro.fr to add at line 3:

#include <stdio.h>
#include <sys/types.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

Added at line 18 to filewrap.c:
#include "AdjustWrite.c"

Added at line 3 to filewrap.h:
#include "AdjustWrite.h"

Added into cmach/prims.fr

Added:

#include <stdlib.h>

to ./meta/fc.c, ./meta/dirs.c, main.c, filewrap.c to eliminate "implicit exit" warnings.

Finally, and very important, adjust cmach/prims.fr according to:

752a753
> 	#include "AdjustWrite.x"
757a759
> 	#include "AdjustWrite.x"
