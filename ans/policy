There are several reasons that I am hesitant to release this Forth to the
world:

1.  Although I say that this system conforms to the ANS Forth, I really mean
that it conforms to the draft standard as of January, 1993.  ANS Forth has
not been approved yet as an official standard and it could change.  I would
prefer to wait until the standard is "real".

2.  Although I have no qualms about giving my work away for free, I would feel
somewhat guilty competing with vendors whose livelyhood is selling Forth
systems.  There are already more free Forth systems available than there
are vendors selling them.  I believe that the viability and credibility
of the language would be hurt if every Forth vendor went out of business
because of the plethora of free systems available.

3.  An alternative to 2 would be to sell or license the system.  I am not
sure that APL is capable or willing to do that.  There are other complications:
we would have to pay a royalty to the author of the DOS extender on
each copy sold.  Also, since the system was compiled by the GNU C compiler
some of Free Software Foundation's copyrights might apply.

So, for now I have just been giving away the system to people I know.  This
is not necessarily restricted to APL.  I have given the system to people
I know at Goddard, for example.  By only distributing the system "1-deep" I
can notify users of bugs found and/or fixed and I can limit the number of
copies that are floating around.

I am not adamant about this policy; new arguments could persuade me to change my
mind.
