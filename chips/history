Mon Feb 21 09:51:52 EST 1994
Added ability to redirect cross-compiler log information to a file
(modified meta1.fr and added sysparam.fr).  By default the log goes
to stdout.  Improved format of log.  Defines have similar format
to Forth word entries.  Report will summarize memory usage.

Sun Feb 27 11:17:42 EST 1994
Renamed dumpobj to dump in meta1.fr.

Wed Mar  2 10:42:50 EST 1994
Deleted primitives of dubious utility from FRISC3, FRISC4, and RTX
kernels: 2+ 2- 4+ 4- 4* 4/ tuck

Thu Mar  3 11:10:34 EST 1994
Modified cross-compiling words loop and +loop in meta2.fr to break
optimizer after unloop compiled.  This fixes some, but not all of
the problems here.

Sat Mar  5 11:09:59 EST 1994
Changed nextprocess to no longer count on contiguity of process initializer
and run-time descriptor.  Changed all user primitves in procprim.fr to
expect process-descriptor initializer data structures as arguments.
Modified process: in process.fr so that child returns initializer
instead of run-time structure (note: this is inconsistent with @run
and @head which return the run-time structure).  Added process.mfr
to allow cross-compilation of processes.

Mon May 16 17:03:02 EDT 1994
Change acts-like in meta1.fr to use *callop* instead of just patching
in an address and assuming it is a call instruction.

Tue May 17 11:11:48 EDT 1994
Added warning to acts-like if interactive version of defining
word does not exist.

Tue Aug  2 10:35:48 EDT 1994
Added used to meta2.fr:  searches for files to load from a list
of directories in the FTPATH environment variable.

Thu Oct  6 09:16:00 EDT 1994
Fixed immediate in meta2.fr to not set precedence bit in target memory
unless 'immediate'd word has a head.

Mon Dec 12 16:32:22 EST 1994
Modified interpret and endinterp in os.fr so that unknown words
do not cause rest of line to be discarded (when in compile state).
This avoids a cascade of error messages.  Revised above:
deleted endinterp and added "interpreting?".

Fri Dec 16 09:52:13 EST 1994
Added cross-compiling versions of h# and d# to meta2.fr.
Also modified cross-compiler to not discard lines on error.

Mon Apr 17 10:31:09 EDT 1995
Reorganized os.fr so that ." was available to compiler.  This allows
rtx/compiler.fr to issue a warning message (see rtx/history).

Thu May 18 12:29:12 EDT 1995
Change cr in forthio.fr to emit carriage return before linefeed instead
of vice-versa.  This makes life easier for programs that control
Forth over the serial line.

Tue Jul 11 14:46:30 EDT 1995
Modified meta2.fr and os.fr to allow cross-compilation of local variables.

Fri Jul 21 10:51:08 EDT 1995
Fixed limitation in meta1.fr that limited number of target wordlists to
eight.

Wed Jan 24 12:50:56 EST 1996
Modified process.mfr to add "process:" to log.

Thu Mar  7 13:03:02 EST 1996
Modified next-boot: and every-boot: in boot.mfr to log anonymous routines
in memory map file.

Thu Mar  7 13:03:40 EST 1996
Modified boot.mfr, bootdata.fr and startup.fr so that EVERY-BOOT is in
ROM and next-boot: is only available in RAM-based systems.  (The latter
is a problem for ROM-based systems that permit initialized RAM
regions, e.g. the interpreter.)

Tue May 19 09:18:30 EDT 1998
Modified os.fr to align dictionary pointer before defining variable,
2variable, or :noname objects.  Added word "align-here" to facilitate
this.  Made equivalent changes in meta2.fr and struct.mfr for cross
versions of variable, 2variables, and makestruct.

Wed Jun  3 10:06:59 EDT 1998
Modified os.fr and startup.fr to initialize vocabtag properly.  Originally
vocabtag was initialized with the value the cross compiler was using
when os.fr was compiled.  This is incorrect if more vocabs/wordlists are
cross-compiled subsequently.  This initialization is now setup from
startup.fr.

Wed Jun  3 10:09:19 EDT 1998
Modified meta1.fr's cross version of ' (tic) to search all wordlists in
target search order, not just target forth wordlist.

Tue Sep 15 14:43:48 EDT 1998
Modified meta2.fr so that : and ; hide and reveal the host version of
the word.  This is so that things like ": foo ... ;  : foo ... foo ... ;"
work correctly.  Also added recurse cross-compiling word to meta2.fr
and modified depth and .s in os.fr to use recurse instead of counting
on named recursion bug.  Note: the fix to : and ; are non-portable.

Thu Jan 21 15:08:03 EST 1999
Added cross versions of 2@ and 2! to meta1.fr.

Mon Jan 25 10:13:40 EST 1999
Moved "stdregion allocatefrom" to doforth in os.fr; it should be executed
every boot.  Modified startup.fr to initialize dp and vocabtag at cross-
compile time.  There are already other places in the interpreter that
depend on RAM locations initialized at compile time (e.g. the dictionary
hash table) so there is no harm in adding more.

Mon Jan 25 10:37:28 EST 1999
Deleted next-boot and every-boot from os.fr.  While next-boot: and every-boot:
are useful for partioning the components of the Forth system, they are not
sufficiently general to expose to end users.

Thu Feb  4 14:32:58 EST 1999
In os.fr, moved initialization of interpreter variables from doforth
to every-boot.  This allows interpreter features (e.g. allot) to be
used before interpreter is actually started.
