Removed warm-boot from system.  It fails if the watchdog is on, since
the boot ROM will not prevent a watchdog reset following a warm-boot.

Modified dpuinit.fr to initialize CR.  Also removed setting of IMR
for UART interrupts and all others masked.  The idea is to make
dpuinit.fr applicable to all DPU systems.  Modified wart.fr to unmask
UART interrupt without any other changes to IMR (see ../history).

Removed initialization of CR from dpuinit.fr; it was incorrect for NEAR
DPU.
