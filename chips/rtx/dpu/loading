To save forth in DPU EEPROM:

1.  ftp to ulysses:
	cd /homes/john/forth/chips/rtx/dpu
	get dpudir.int
	get dpudat.int
	bye

2.  Put ftp'ed files onto GSE host computer.

3.  Reset DPU and send null command within 10 seconds.

4.  Load files (dpudir.int and dpudat.int) over 1553 bus to boot ROM.
Use the file_open menu item in GSEOS with .int (Intel) mode.


Note:  At the time I left for Huntsville, only the XGRS version of
GSEOS supported Intel loads.  Al and Thomas planned to update
the other GSEOS versions.  If this has not happened, there are numerous
alternative ways to load the DPU (e.g. over the serial port).
