Greetings,

   This message is to inform you that I have made a substantial
change to the RTX Forth multitasker.  Each process now has its
own view of 'far' memory.  The register that identifies the remote
page (DPR) is saved on context switch, as is the near/far (DPRSEL)
mode.  If you use the multitasker, you should get the new version
from the Forth server; a separate message will explain how to do
that.  A memo documenting the system is available.
