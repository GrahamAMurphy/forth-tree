		Known Bugs and Limitations

Forth system:
   The system is case sensitive and all Forth words are lower case.
   However, input number conversion is case insensitive (0a = 0A).

   Strings passed to find must be greater than `namesize' characters
or padded out with blanks.

   : foo [ :noname ; ( foo is now findable)

   last-colon is not initialized.

   :noname does not align the dictionary pointer before compiling.
Similarly, variable does not align dictionary pointer before laying down
initial value.

Cross-compiler:
	In ROM-based system, RAM address must be higher than ROM address
or the cross-compiler will crash.

	push-stream and pop-stream (and unloop on RTX) are subroutines
that do things with the return stack.  Therefore, the optimizer should
not convert a call/return to a branch.  push-stream and pop-stream
are handled with explicit || statements in os.fr.  meta2.fr handles
the unloop case compiled automatically by loop.  An explicit unloop
is not handled however.  A general solution is needed here.

	There are several problems compiling next-boot:/every-boot:
for ROM.  See bootdata.fr.

	Cross-compiling word abort" is missing.

	When using modules3.fr, private constants, etc. can leak out
of their respective modules.  This is because the \constant is put
in a separate wordlist.

	When using modules3.fr, structure names cannot be made public, e.g.,
public:
structure my-struct
private:
This is because the structure name doesn't actually get compiled until
endstructure (to work around another bug).
