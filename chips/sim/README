This directory contains the source code for simulations of the 
FRISC 3 (aka SC32) and FRISC 4 Forth-oriented microprocessors.
FRISC 4 is still under construction.
File names containing a 3 pertain to FRISC 3 and those containing
a 4 pertain to FRISC 4; all others are shared.

To compile FRISC 3 simulators type:
	make fsim3 nifsim3
fsim3 is an interactive simulator and gives a register level view
of FRISC 3 (via the curses library).  nifsim3 is a non-interactive
version.  To run the simulator type:
	fsim3 file
where file is a FRISC 3 program.  If the file contains an entire
FRISC 3 Forth system, the system can be simulated (with reasonable
response times) by typing:
	startat 0
	sim 0xfffff

These programs have been tested on Sun 3 and Sun 4 systems.
There is a snippet of assembly language in aluops.s.
The programs have run on Masscomp and Vaxes in the not too
distant past.
