DDDDDDDDDDDDDDD: Call destination address
Note: shifted left one bit to form byte address of destination instruction.

BB: Block
	00 = branch to same block
	01 = branch to next block
	10 = branch to block 0
	11 = branch to previous block

FFFFFFFFF: Branch destination address
Note: shifted left one bit to form byte address of destination instruction.

SS: Data stack operation
	00 = nop	T -> T	N -> N
	01 = push	T -> T	T -> N	N -> stack
	10 = pop	N -> T	stack -> N
	11 = swap	N -> T	T -> N
Note: If a T destination is specified by the instruction type, then that
is what happens.  Otherwise, the source of T is determined by the stack op.

R: Return
	0 = nop
	1 = return

IIIII: Short immediate operand: 0 - 31
iiiiiiiiiiiiiiii: Long immediate operand: 0 - 65535

L: Scale factor for long immediate
	0 = 1
	1 = 2^16 (32-bit only)

AAAA: Arithmetic operation

	0001 = a
	0010 = b + a
	0011 = b + a + Fl
	0100 = b - a		b + ~a + 1

aaaa: Step operation
	0000 = multiply		3-bit modified Booth multiply step

rrrr: Register

	1001 = CPR (16-bit only)

OO: Shift operation
	00 = logical shift right (zero fill)
	01 = arithmetic shift right (sign fill)
	10 = shift left (zero fill)
	11 = rotate left (fill form MSBs)

MM: Memory size
	00 = byte
	01 = 16-bit word
	10 = 32-bit word (32-bit only)
	11 = TBD

s: Special
	0 = disable far memory (16-bit only)
	1 = enable far memory (16-bit only)

Notes:
- CallL adds subroutine call beyond 32 bits.
- Call MS bits appended from PC.
- Immediate values are zero-extended.
- 8-bit and 16-bit load values are zero-extended.
- Load and store of 16-bit or 32-bit values must be to even addresses.
- Load and store use big-endian format.
- The 4-bit nibble layout of the instruction is serendipitously makes
reading object code easy.
- If an instruction pushes or pops the return stack and does a return,
the result is undefined.
- In an instruction writes the PCR register and pushes or pops the data
stack or does a return, the result is undefined.
- Reading PCR holds off interrupts for one cycle.  TBD: others?
TBD: writing CPR holds off interrupts?

Variations:
- PC < 32 bits.  How many bits?
