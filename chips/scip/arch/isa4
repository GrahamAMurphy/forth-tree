DDDDDDDDDDDDDDD: Call destination address
Note: shifted left one bit to form byte address of destination instruction.

BB: Block
	00 = branch to same block
	01 = branch to next block
	10 = branch to block 0
	11 = branch to previous block

FFFFFFFFF: Branch destination address
Note: shifted left one bit to form byte address of destination instruction.

SS: Data stack operation
	00 = nop	T -> T	N -> N
	01 = push	T -> T	T -> N	N -> stack
	10 = pop	N -> T	stack -> N
	11 = swap	N -> T	T -> N
Note: If a T destination is specified by the instruction type, then that
is what happens.  Otherwise, the source of T is determined by the stack op.

R: Return
	0 = nop
	1 = return

IIIII: Short immediate operand: 0 - 31
iiiiiiiiiiiiiiii: Long immediate operand: 0 - 65535

S: Scale factor for long immediate
	0 = 1
	1 = 2^16

AAAA: Arithmetic operation
	0000 = b
	0001 = a
	0010 = b + a
	0011 = b + a + Fl
	0100 = b - a		b + ~a + 1
	0101 = b - a - Fl	b + ~a + Fl
	0110 = -b + a		~b + a + 1
	0111 = -b + a - Fl	~b + a + Fl
	1000 = ~b
	1001 = ~a
	1010 = a + 1
	1011 = a - 1
	1100 = a . b
	1101 = a | b
	1110 = a ^ b
	1111 = Fl

aaaa: Step operation
	0000 = multiply		3-bit modified Booth multiply step
	0001 = divide1		non-restoring divide step
	0010 = divide2		non-restoring divide cleanup step
	others reserved

CCCC: Condition
	0000 = 0
	0001 = 1
	0010 = V
	0011 = ~V

	1110 = C.~Z		u>
	1111 = ~C|Z		u<=

rrr: Register
	000 = R
	001 = R (read pops return stack, write pushes return stack)
	010 = MD
	011 = UDR
	100 = PC (read only)
	101 = PSW (ie|se|ptop:4|pover:4|rtop:4|rover:4)
	110 = PSP
	111 = RSP

OO: Shift operation
	00 = logical shift right (zero fill)
	01 = arithmetic shift right (sign fill)
	10 = shift left
	11 = rotate left

MM: Memory size
	00 = byte
	01 = 16-bit word
	10 = 32-bit word
	11 = TBD

Notes:
- CallL adds subroutine call beyond 32 bits.
- Call MS bits appended from PC.
- Immediate values are zero-extended.
- 8-bit and 16-bit load values are zero-extended.
- Load and store of 16-bit or 32-bit values must be to even addresses.
- Load and store use big-endian format.
- The 4-bit nibble layout of the instruction is serendipitously makes
reading object code easy.
- If an instruction pushes or pops the return stack and does a return,
the result is undefined.
- In an instruction writes the PSW register and pushes or pops the data
stack or does a return, the result is undefined.
- Reading PSW holds off interrupts for one cycle.  TBD: others?

Variations:
- PC < 32 bits.  How many bits?
- 3-bit Reg field has room to expand to 4 bits.
- Instruction set is also suitable for 16-bit datapath.  Would need to
add CPR, DPR, and near/far bit.  PSW is >16 bits though.
