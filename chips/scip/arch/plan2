Next year we will look at coprocessor architectures that could be
customized to support future applications.  Coprocessors to consider
include floating-point, compression, and particle/event processing.  A
full-featured floating-point unit will not fit in the FPGAs available
to us.  We will look at a modular floating-point design that can be
tailored for specific applications.  Hardware assistance for data
compression will enhance future missions.  Possible algorithms for
implementation in hardware include Chebychev, DCT (JPEG), and wavelet
(JPEG-2000).  Finally, an event coprocessor could enhance future
particle instruments.  We will look at moving GUVI's event processing
algorithm into hardware such that it is reconfigurable and tailorable
for future missions, e.g. AURORA.

This year we implemented the New Horizons spacecraft interface as part
of the SCIP technology demonstration.  This year we will look at
current and emerging spacecraft interface standards.  Incorporating a
1553 remote terminal into the SCIP FPGA could eliminate an entire board
on missions that use the 1553 bus.  An emerging interface is ESA's
SpaceWire.  We will look at hardware and software integration of
SpaceWire into a SCIP processor board.
