1. Compile 16-bit version of processor plus an interrupt controller and
UART for Xilinx FPGA.  Xilinx (TBD: name) development board with FPGA,
RAM, EEPROM, and RS-232 I/O will be used.  The processor will be tested
by loading ANSI Forth regression tests over the RS-232 port.

2. To the above add another UART to the FPGA and New Horizons (NH)
RS-422 I/O drivers and connector to the board.  Connect to a NH
spacecraft emulator and GSEOS computer.  Run NH common software on
processor; test via regression scripts running on GSEOS.

3. To the above add I2C master and John Boldt's backplane bus to the
chip and connect board to LORRI image interface board.  Run LORRI
software on processor.

4. Compile a 32-bit version of processor plus an interrupt controller
and UART.  Test as per number 1 above.
