Added heads to "md@" and "md!".  This allows some libraries to be
implemented more efficiently.  These words are not intended for
end-users.

Mask off interrupts as part of "safe" function.  Because this is not
part of the processor, it is implementation/board specific.  Assumes
that "#ints" defines number of interrupts and "mask-int" exists to mask
off interrupts.  Board-specific code must be compiled before "safe".
Consequently, "safe" and other initialization functions were moved from
stacks.fr into a new file, inits.fr.  kernel2.fr was modified to load
inits.fr.

Stack empty functions pspreset and spreset can fail if interrupted.
Rewrite so that update of SCR and PSP/RSP are done atomically.

Fixed bug in pspreset in stacknotask.fr.

Modified 32-bit architecture to fetch interrupt vector and make short
calls with respect to CPR.  Modified cross-compiler and Forth interpreter
compiler accordingly.

Did a number of code clean-ups, mostly invisible to users.  Added support
for per-process "user" variables.  Removed "w," from 16-bit version.
