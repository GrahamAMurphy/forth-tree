\ Note: test can be run with a continuous interrupt source (i.e.  "1
\ interrupt" commanded in the simulator.  The interrupt routine reenables
\ interrupts on completion by writing the PCR.  This has the side-effect
\ of holding off interrupts for one cycle.  One instruction will execute
\ before the next interrupt response.  Therefore, an interrupt will occur
\ after almost every instruction in the test.  This is a good test of the
\ interrupt logic.  Also, there are some explicit tests of interrupt
\ hold-off (intholdofftest) that are only meaningful in the presence of
\ the continuous interrupt.
