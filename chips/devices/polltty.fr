\		Generic Polled Character Device Driver
\	This version of the driver supports the following features:
\		polled I/O
\		maps <cr> to <nl> on input
hex

\ The following defines are required to use this program:
\  TXRDYMASK - Active high mask identifying transmitter ready bit in UARTSTAT
\  RXRDYMASK - Active high mask identifying receiver ready bit in UARTSTAT
\ The following functions are also needed:
\  uart-status - Returns UART status
\  uart@ - Returns received character
\  uart! - Transmits character

: emit		\ ( char --- ) Transmit one character.
   TXRDYMASK				\ txrdy status mask
   begin 
      uart-status over and		\ get txrdy bit
   until				\ loop until bit is one
   drop uart! ;

: key		\ ( --- char ) Read one character.
   RXRDYMASK				\ rxrdy status mask
   begin
      uart-status over and		\ get rxrdy bit
   until				\ loop until bit is one
   drop uart@
   dup 0d = if drop 0a then ;

: key?		\ ( -- t/f ) Return true if a character is ready.
   uart-status RXRDYMASK and 0= not ;
